An electricity board charges the following rates for the use of electricity: for the first 200 units 80 paise per unit: for the next 100 units 90 paise per unit: beyond 300 units Rs 1 per unit. All users are charged a minimum of Rs. 100 as meter charge. If the total amount is more than Rs.400, then an additional surcharge of 15% of total amount is charged. Write a program to read the name of the user, number of units consumed and print out the charges.
