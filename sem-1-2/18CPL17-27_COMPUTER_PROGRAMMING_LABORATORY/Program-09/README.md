# Program 09

Develop a Program to compute Sin(x) using Taylor Series approximation. Compare your result with the built-in Library function. Print both the results with appropriate messages. 

## Output

```shell
$ gedit program-09.c
$ gcc program-09.c

$ ./a.out
Enter the value in degrees: 90
Enter the number of terms in Taylor series expansion: 10
Calculated = 1.000000
Builtin function = 1.000000

$ ./a.out
Enter the value in degrees: 45
Enter the number of terms in Taylor series expansion: 10
Calculated = 0.707107
Builtin function = 0.707107

$ ./a.out
Enter the value in degrees: 73
Enter the number of terms in Taylor series expansion: 10
Calculated = 0.956305
Builtin function = 0.956305

```
