    b. Traverse the BST in Inorder, Preorder and Post Order
    c. Search the BST for a given element (KEY) and report the appropriate message
    d. Delete an element(ELEM) from BST
    e. Exit 
#### Program-11
    Design, Develop and Implement a Program in C for the following operations on Graph(G) of Cities
    a. Create a Graph of N cities using Adjacency Matrix.
    b. Print all the nodes reachable from a given starting node in a digraph using BFS method
    c. Check whether a given graph is connected or not using DFS method.
#### Program-12 
    Given a File of N employee records with a set K of Keys(4-digit) which uniquely determine the records
    in file F. Assume that file F is maintained in memory by a Hash Table(HT) of m memory locations
    with L as the set of memory addresses (2-digit) of locations in HT. Let the keys in K and addresses in L
    are Integers. Design and develop a Program in C that uses Hash function H: K Â®L as H(K)=K mod m
    (remainder method), and implement hashing technique to map a given key K to the address space L.
    Resolve the collision (if any) using linear probing. 

## Installation and  requirements
