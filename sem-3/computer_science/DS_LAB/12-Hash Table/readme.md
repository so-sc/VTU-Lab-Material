# Program 12
Given a File of N employee records with a set K of Keys(4-digit) which uniquely determine the records
in file F. Assume that file F is maintained in memory by a Hash Table(HT) of m memory locations
with L as the set of memory addresses (2-digit) of locations in HT. Let the keys in K and addresses in L
are Integers. Design and develop a Program in C that uses Hash function H: K Â®L as H(K)=K mod m
(remainder method), and implement hashing technique to map a given key K to the address space L.
Resolve the collision (if any) using linear probing.

## OUTPUT:
```shell
