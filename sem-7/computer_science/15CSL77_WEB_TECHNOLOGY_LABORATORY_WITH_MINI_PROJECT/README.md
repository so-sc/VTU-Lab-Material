# Installation and requirements 
1. Install any one of the following web server applications
    - [WampServer](http://www.wampserver.com/en/) for Windows users only
    - [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html) for both Windows and Linux users.
    - WampServer root-folder:- `c:\wamp\www\`
    - XAMPP root-folder:- **Windows:**`c:\xampp\htdocs\ `,  **Linux:**`/opt/lampp/htdocs/`
2. Click [here](https://github.com/so-sc/VTU-Lab-Material/archive/master.zip) to download the repository and unzip it or run the below command.
    ```sh
    $ git clone https://github.com/so-sc/VTU-Lab-Material.git
    ``` 
3. Copy folder at `VTU-Lab-Material/sem-7/computer_science/15CSL77_WEB_TECHNOLOGY_LABORATORY_WITH_MINI_PROJECT` to any one of the **respective root-folder**
4. Start the webserver and open your browser and enter the following to list all the programs
    ```sh
    localhost/15CSL77_WEB_TECHNOLOGY_LABORATORY_WITH_MINI_PROJECT/
    ```
### Running the PHP programs with live error logs in Linux Systems
If you are using a Ubuntu or any other Linux Distro, you can run the PHP files without copying the downloaded files into PHP serve bay. Simply execute the following command within the directory of the source file.
```shell
$ php -S localhost:8000
```
This will create a temporary PHP server for that particular directory, and you can view the rendered files from your browser at `localhost:8000/filename`, If there are any errors in your PHP files, that will be logged in your terminal.

##### Hint: For the 10th program make sure SQL service is up and running as well

##### **Testing: The above programs have both been tested in Linux and Windows for XAMPP as well as WampServer for Windows.**
