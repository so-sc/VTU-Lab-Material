# VTU Lab Material [![SOSC](https://is.gd/visit_sosc_badge)](https://sosc.org.in)
#### Collection of VTU laboratory easy solutions and related educational material maintained **by the students, for the students, to the students**. 💪🏻 

## Motivation
Ever had trouble getting the right VTU lab material to study from? Well look no further here's a collection of all resources required gathered and verified with respective laboratory incharge by students over at [Sahyadri Open Source Community](https://sosc.org.in)

## Getting started
The folder structure is arranged according to `semester/branch/subject_code+subject_name/file_name`
```sh
.
├── sem-7
│   ├── computer_science
│   │   ├── 15CSL76_MACHINE_LEARNING_LABORATORY
│   │   │   ├── 01. Find-S Algorithm.ipynb
│   │   │   ├── 01. Find-S Algorithm.py
.   .   .   .
.   .   .   .
```
If the Lab experiments contain more than one file, create a seprate sub directory for each experiment. eg `/semester/branch/subject_code_subject_name/experiment_no_experiment_name/filename`
```sh
.
├── sem-7
│   ├── computer_science
│   │   ├── 15CSL77_WEB_PROGRAMMING_LABORATORY
│   │   │   ├── 01 Calculator
│   │   │   |   ├── index.html
│   │   │   |   ├── style.css
.   .   .   .   .
